# opencv_tries
is a portofolio repository to try computer vision code. Contains:
- opencv_preprocessing: code to try preprocessing an image using open cv library to test colorings, scikit and pytorch algorithms such as poolings, CLAHE.
- transferlearning_densenet: code to try pytorch transfer learning to predict MNIST dataset. Used densenet as transfer learning model.
